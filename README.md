## Description

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the IMDB Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost mini-project should provide enough background.
You can walk through entire process using notebook in [project](Project/) directory or check final result in the [index.html](Project/website/index.html).
